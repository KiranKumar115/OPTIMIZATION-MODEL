DESCRIPTION:
Optimization plays a key role in data science, where the goal is often to find the best possible solution to a problem within a set of constraints. An optimization model is a mathematical framework designed to minimize or maximize an objective function — such as cost, profit, time, or accuracy — by systematically selecting values for decision variables.

These models are widely used across domains like supply chain management, finance, logistics, marketing, and machine learning.

Tools and Libraries
Several Python libraries support optimization modeling:

Scipy.optimize – For basic optimization problems

PuLP – For linear and integer programming

CVXPY – For convex optimization

Pyomo – For complex mathematical modeling

Google OR-Tools – For advanced routing and scheduling problems

These tools allow data scientists to build and solve optimization models with minimal code, while still offering flexibility and scalability.
